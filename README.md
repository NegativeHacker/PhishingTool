# PhishingTool

I am in no way responsible for your actions, this script is for educational purposes

❗❗❗ To use the phishing tool you need to have node.js and install the npm ngrok module ❗❗❗

At the moment there is only one phishing tool (the one of microsoft ) else may arrive soon

1️⃣ Start serveur.js with your Node.js IDE ▶️

2️⃣ Open the terminal and share the link display to the victim 💻

3️⃣ Wait until you receive the victim's password and username 🔐

4️⃣ Enjoy 😉

if you want to see how the tool works I made a video --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv95imnOblw
